# PyCitySchools

By utilizing the provided data of the 15 different schools, I was able to find plenty of interesting information. The overall passing rate for BOTH reading and math in all schools came out to 65.17%, below the passing mark of 70%. However for the individual subjects, reading came out to an average of 85.8%. while math came out at 74.98%.

Taking a deeper dive into this data, I found that the schools with the best scores for reading and math actually have some of the lowest budget per student. Cabrera High School has a 91.33% overall passing rate with just $582 per student, while Huang High School spends the most at $655 per student but only scores 53.51%.

Another interesting point that was found when analyzing this data is that all top 5 high schools are actually charter schools, while the bottom 5 are all district high schools. The top 5 high schools all have an average overall passing rate above 90%. They also have between 93-95% of students passing math and 95.9-97.4% of students passing their reading classes. The lowest scoring high schools all came in under 53.6%. However they all have between 80-81.2% of students passing reading but seemed to be lacking in math where the highest of the 5 came in at 66.75%, and the lowest at 65.68% 

Overall I found that the charter schools in this dataset is outperforming the district schools regardless of the difference of the budget per student.
